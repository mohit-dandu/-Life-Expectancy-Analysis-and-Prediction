# Life-Expectancy-Analysis-and-Prediction
* Life expectancy is a crucial metric for assessing population health that captures mortality along the entire life course.
* The objective of our project was to analyze data on life expectancy and relevant factors for countries around the world in a given time frame.
* We used multiple linear regression and decision tree models to predict life expectancy for different countries and understand the factors affecting it.
* Our models consider variables such as healthcare spending, education level, GDP and other socio-economic factors that may impact life expectancy.
* The developed models will enable predicting life expectancy for different countries, aiding in making health care service predictions and improving population health outcomes.

## General Information
The purpose of this research problem is to predict and possibly improve human health. When we find the correct relationships between the health indicators and life expectancy, it is possible for us to increase human life expectancy. Our research problem was critical because we planned to run the multiple regression model and decision tree on our dataset. We were able to see the relationship among all independent variables and the dependent variable "life expectancy". We used our data results to further predict life expectancy and ran the prescriptive analysis for decision-making in health, economy, immunization, and mortality.


## Technologies Used
Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels.api


## Features
List the ready features here:
* The models developed in this project can predict life expectancy, which will aid in gathering health data, increasing healthcare service predictions, and suggesting areas for improvement.
* The results of the project will enable countries to identify contributing factors that impact life expectancy, improve service quality, and determine where to allocate resources.
* We got a mean absolute error equal to 2.563 degrees, using which we calculated the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and calculated the accuracy which was 96.13%.



## Setup
The project requirements/dependencies are listed in the import statements at the beginning of the code:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* statsmodels.api
* plotly
* sklearn

To set up your local environment and get started with the project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Python on your computer if you haven't already done so. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project files.

3. Clone the project repository using Git or download the project files directly from the repository.

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following commands in your command prompt or terminal window: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels plotly scikit-learn`

5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can open the Jupyter Notebook file containing the project code and run the code cells to execute the project.



## Usage
This project will be useful for Insurance companies as they consider age, lifestyle, family medical history and several other factors when determining premium rates for individual life insurance policies. The principle of life expectancy will suggest the life insurance policy for an individual. For Nation as whole the results will help to increase the expectancy considering the impact of a specific factor on the average lifespan of people living in a specific country. The focus can be shifted to better health care services to improve life quality of their citizens.
